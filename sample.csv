37,38,"This paper analyzes and compares two mental mapping studies–one with young people (aged 16–19) in Finland and one with Finnish and Russian young people (aged 9–15) in the Finnish-Russian borderland. These studies show that mental mapping is a valuable method which can illuminate crucial aspects of how borders and bordering are related to young people’s territorial identifications. We argue that it is important to pay special attention to the research methodology, including the mapping scale and the complementary data collection methods, as these determine what aspects of borders and bordering in young people’s territorial identifications can be discovered, and how profoundly identification processes can be studied with mental maps. This paper contributes to the theoretical discussion on borders and territorial identity by visualizing the complexity of how borders and territorial identifications are intertwined, and how young people engage in the social, cultural and mental construction of borders and the negotiation of territorial identities. The paper enriches the mental mapping methodology by demonstrating two different ways mental maps can be used for studying young people’s territorial identifications. © 2020, © 2020 Association for Borderlands Studies.","Karelian Institute, University of Eastern Finland, Joensuu, Finland

24,25,"Public open spaces are key to cities, as a place where society can create and recreate public life. Thus, we aim to investigate the production of these areas in slums through concepts such as “right to the city”, “return to the city”, accessibility, mobility, and the implications of fragmentation and segregation, in promoting the socio-integration into the city. The empirical object is the “Beira Molhada” slum in João Pessoa, Paraíba, because of its inclusion in peri-urban area and of environmental preservation, with large public open spaces. The methodology consists of literature and documentary research, mental maps and geo-referenced analyticals. The results indicate an issue poorly related with city and environmental goods under threat. However, there is great potential for socio-spatial integration of the slum with the city, by encouraging social dynamic that provides accessibility and mobility to the environmental heritage and its fruition, contributing to the establishment of an “urban society” as stated by Lefebvre. © Editora CHAMPAGNAT.

29,30,"Over the last decade, much research has assessed sport in relation to geographical perspectives of place, landscape, and identity. Using multiple qualitative methods, including mental maps, interviews and conversations, and participant observation, this inductive study attempts to better understand local perceptions of an everyday landscape. This work was conducted in Villa Ascension, a rural community in the Dominican Republic consisting of Haitian and Dominican residents. Football is a strong component of Haitian identity, and baseball is likewise important to Dominicans. Currently, the community has one site where two sports are actively played. Given the community's heterogeneous ethnic composition, Villa Ascension's sports landscape is recognised as having multiple layers of meaning. Knowledge produced in this case study revealed the emergent themes of perceived interpretations of ordinary landscapes, the forging of boundaries, communal relationships and support, and hazards and modification of limited spaces for play. The landscape being a layered one with multiple representations of place and identity, the Haitians' broader perceptions suggest that they view the site as a place of primary importance. Alternatively, the Dominicans are attempting to forge and maintain their sense of sporting identity in the landscape. © 2014 Institute of Australian Geographers.","Department of Management, Glasgow School for Business and Society, Hamish Wood Building, Glasgow Caledonian University, Cowcaddens Road, Glasgow, G4 0BA, United Kingdom","Wise, N.",2014,,Geographical Research,Layers of the landscape: Representations and perceptions of an ordinary (shared) sports landscape in a Haitian and Dominican community
22,23,"Over the last two decades a vibrant body of research committed to investigating the complex inter-relationships between ‘the social’ and ‘the spatial’ has gathered momentum within sociology and the social sciences more generally. Focusing on young people, this article seeks to develop further insights regarding the sociology of place using the spatial visualization technique of mental mapping as part of a mixed-methods approach. Its main contribution is to develop a more nuanced understanding of young people’s localized cognitive spaces and associated socio-spatial influences in three deprived urban areas in Hull, Walsall and Wolverhampton. In this context, the article explores the role of place in shaping young people’s social networks, identities and aspirations regarding employment and highlights the implications of these for future research. © The Author(s) 2015","Sheffield Hallam University, United Kingdom

69,70,"As public spaces are often designed based on adults’ behavioural patterns and perceptions, children’s perceptions and physical needs based on their body size have received less attention in both the design of urban spaces and urban studies. Focusing on the interpretive reproduction theory, this study aims to investigate children’s perceptions of urban spaces. Using behaviour and mental mapping, this paper examines children’s activities in public spaces as well as their mental images of such spaces. Behaviour mapping was conducted over 37 days on the Zrêbar Lake Waterfront in Kurdistan. Sketches drawn by 36 children were then analysed to identify children’s perceptions of the Waterfront. Unlike conventional methods in which children’s demands are determined through caregivers, this study focuses on engagement with children. Results indicate that two main factors of actualised environmental affordances (AEA) and safety-conscious parenting practices (SPP) have a significant influence on children’s freedom of movement (CFM) and consequently children’s activities in public spaces. © Urban Studies Journal Limited 2020.","University of Kurdistan, Iran

This paper expands this scholarship by describing a participatory research methodology that aimed to facilitate knowledge sharing between indigenous peoples, and support indigenous community efforts to consider different knowledge claims and negotiate indigenous knowledge that could be used for environmental risk assessments and management responses. We draw on two case studies to show how a participatory mapping approach enabled Aboriginal people connected to the Girringun Indigenous Corporation (Girringun) in northern Australia to negotiate the knowledge needed to assess the environmental risks that affect their territories. Individuals painted and drew maps of their values, knowledge, and management aspirations for water and native vegetation. These maps were shared with the wider group to enable the consideration of different perspectives and the negotiation of agreed risks affecting local watersheds and native vegetation. These maps were also used to facilitate the design of knowledge partnerships among the Girringun tribal groups, staff, and other collaborators that are critical to re-framing and co-managing the environmental risks affecting this region of northern Australia. © 2015, Springer Japan.","CSIRO Land and Water, Dutton Park, QLD, Australia

25,26,"Suburbanization as a key process transforming the hinterland of cities has been researched by human geographers for a long time. The study of suburbanization involves the application of a wide spectrum of methods or analytic tools falling within the groups of quantitative, qualitative and combined approaches. One of the possibilities to study this process is mental mapping that we primarily use as an instrument for examining the character of suburban environment, its perception by local inhabitants, their experience of and relation to the place of living. The aim of this study is to look at the environment of the suburban municipalities in the hinterland of Olomouc by means of mental mapping. We use concrete examples of sketches to describe and interpret the outputs of perception of the researched suburban municipalities and their components by local inhabitants. Despite schematization, incompleteness or distortion, the results of the study prove that character of their mental maps mostly depends on how much time the inhabitants spend in their municipalities, whether they participate in the collective life or use a map of the municipality and what their relation to place of living is. © 2015 Human Geographies; The authors.","Palacký University, Czech Republic

68,69,"Abstract: In recent decades, neighbourhood regeneration has often involved social mixing strategies, often through comprehensive renewal. By deconcentrating poverty and giving opportunities for social interaction, remaining residents are believed to benefit from middle-class presence. This study looks at a post-war neighbourhood in Amsterdam which has undergone comprehensive renewal. By making use of survey data in combination with GIS techniques, this study shows that perceptions are structured by physical characteristics, activity patterns and symbolic boundaries. These perceptions are highly dependent on social position. While some residents in renewal areas display inclusionary attitudes, there is also evidence of middle-class and lower class disaffiliation. Interestingly, these translate into different mental maps for both groups. The paper ends with a methodological reflection on using GIS-based boundary drawing in neighbourhood surveys to gauge fragmentation and place-based displacement. © 2016 IBF, The Institute for Housing and Urban Research.","Centre for Urban Studies, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands",,2016,Social mix,"Housing, Theory and Society",Surveying the Fault Lines in Social Tectonics; Neighbourhood Boundaries in a Socially-mixed Renewal Area

They are particularly difficult to forecast accurately and there is little lead time for warning. This makes motorists especially vulnerable.

This study employs an under-utilised methodology offering strong potential for overcoming some of the difficulties associated with neighbourhood definitions. A mental mapping exercise involving local residents is showcased for an ethnically diverse working-class neighbourhood in south Liverpool. The results demonstrate distinctions between residents in the geographical demarcation of the area and the features included, with important implications for how neighbourhood is best measured and understood.

Based primarily on accessibility to common daily amenities, this quantitative measure is limited to a macro-scale view of urban form that does not consider micro-scale design elements that can significantly impact walking behavior such as building setbacks, sidewalk characteristics, lighting, or traffic volume. This study employed a survey and cognitive mapping exercise to identify neighborhood typologies in which Walk Score and residents’ perceptions of walkability are most likely to align, and, more crucially, where they are most likely to be at odds. Relative to residents’ perceptions, Walk Score tended to overestimate the walkability of suburban strip-mall corridors and underestimate the walkability of recreational areas and small entertainment districts.

65,66,"The present study deals with aspects of the child's construction of mental representations of the contemporary city. Its aim is a compilation of a body of concepts-criteria for the organization of built environments for child activity, environments that will serve in the direction of child education, not simply act as material framework for his activity. The study is organized around two axes of argumentation. The first axis regards the contemporary city itself, the interpretation of its structure, and of the organization of its public space, the qualities linked to the spatio-temporal activity of the individual and social interaction. Subjects emerging from the literature such as alienation, fragmentary experience of space, changes in the public-private relation, and, broader topics such as changes in the identity of the residence area, as well as of the city, provided the orientation for the questions raised in this research. The second axis concerns epistemological issues of the construction of mental representations of space. On this latter level, we attempt to build our approach on the basis of social interactionism, which promotes the concept of activity to a significant factor in the assignment of meaning to space. From this theoretical discussion emerges the concept of socio-spatial strategic activity, which, along with other social and geographical variables, became the tools in the analysis of the data yielded by our field research (interviews, mental maps), conducted in Thessaloniki, on a sample of seventy-seven eleven- and twelve-year-olds. © 2009 by Walter de Gruyter GmbH & Co.

187,188,"From nano-plastics to large sunken vessels, marine debris presents a threat to humans and ecosystems worldwide. Fishermen's knowledge of the sources of, and risks posed by medium to large debris derived from fishing, aquaculture, and other marine industries provides important context for debris mitigation. Public participation geographic information systems (PPGIS) can address these risks by integrating subjective and objective spatial data on human and environmental impacts and risks. We integrated fishermen's perceptions and experiences with marine debris with spatial data using PPGIS. We developed a georeferenced database of fishermen's experiences with marine debris, collected during focus groups and at various other meetings in Southwest New Brunswick. This layer was used to integrate baseline data with subjective perceptions of the ecological, economic, and navigational risks associated with marine debris in the Bay of Fundy, Canada. We also documented the physical, technical, political, and regulatory challenges to marine debris mitigation. These challenges highlight the social and environmental processes that complicate any projects that attempt to develop uncontested spatial representations of marine debris. Finally, we discuss the potential of PPGIS to address these challenges by fostering communication, coordinating various marine activities, helping stakeholders set priorities for clean-up, and implementing collaborative clean-up projects.

9,10,"In many communities in northern Ghana, the environment has been altered by complex natural and human driven forces with significant impact on the lives of their inhabitants. The need to formulate an improved, holistic and consistent methodological approach to assess the problem is critical for sustainable natural resource management. This paper examines the potential of the DPSIR environmental assessment framework utilizing GIS-based participatory methodology in the assessment of environmental degradation in northern Ghana. Community truthing tools such as key informant interviews, focus group discussions, participant observation and participatory Geographical Information Systems (GIS) were employed as a means of soliciting societal responses integrated to conventional GIS spatial analysis to measure the indicators of the Driving force-Pressure-State-Impacts-Response (DPSIR) assessment framework. Post classification GIS imagery results show a marked natural vegetation decrease of 634 km2 (42%) of the study area with a corresponding increase of 600 km2 (39%) of grasses and built-up and barren environment in the period of 14 years from 1990 to 2004. This is attributed to extreme climatic conditions and human driven causes such as poverty, population growth, migration and land tenure system. Poverty reduction strategies, amendment of the Mining and Mineral Law (PNDC law 153), improvement of the existing land tenure system and the control of migrants and Fulani herdsmen from neighbouring Burkina Faso were some of the solutions selected by the research participants, to be emphasized in the National Environmental Action Plan (EPA Act 490).

209,210,"Urban consolidation projects aiming to support a more sustainable urban form are among the most controversial issues in urban planning. Although planning professionals have reached a rather consistent consensus on the structural characteristics of sustainable urban form, i.e. urban consolidation or densification policy, these goals are often not shared by inhabitants. The resistance by local residents towards densification is based on the fear of losing the environmental qualities that they appreciate without getting added value. We argue that a planning strategy that is sensitive to the local context and respects the inhabitants' place experiences can help in finding unique solutions and in restraining conflicts. To realize the context sensitive strategy, new kind of location-based information from residents is needed: experiential knowledge that is tightly anchored to specific places. In this study, 3119 respondents from the Helsinki metropolitan area participated in a Web-based survey that helped define the quality factors meaningful to inhabitants. The softGIS method used is an example of public participation GIS that allows the study of inhabitants' location-based experiences. The over 10,000 place experiences gathered were analysed in relation to the home locations of respondents and to the number of urban structural characteristics, including urban density, green structure proportion, and land-use patterns. The findings revealed that although green structure was experientially very valuable, densely built areas were also meaningful for inhabitants, especially in regard to social quality. We conclude that the 'soft', experiential information can be a welcome addition to the other layers of information in evidence-based planning. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","Aalto University, Department of Surveying and Planning, YTK - Land Use Planning and Urban Studies Group, PO Box 12200, 00076 Aalto, Finland","Kyttä, M.",2013,,Landscape and Urban Planning,Towards contextually sensitive urban densification: Location-based softGIS knowledge revealing perceived residential environmental quality
192,193,"In an increasingly urbanized world, urban green spaces (UGS)are critical for ensuring residents’ health and well-being, due to the ecosystem services provided. Urban planning is being instigated to maximize the potential of UGS to increase responsiveness to major societal and environmental challenges and emerging policy demands. While city-wide perspectives can guide the cities’ governance approach, a more local approach is required to optimize local planning and management of UGS. In this paper we aim to identify the spatial patterns of UGS uses in Lisbon city, Portugal. Specifically, we ask if urban residents have equal accessibility to UGS within their residential zip area and what are the key factors related to residents’ decisions to visit UGS within or outside their zip. We used a Public Participation GIS to collect spatially explicit data about residents most frequented UGS. The survey was directed to respondents from different socio-demographic classes and areas of residence, by using different on-line communication channels, and conducted between February and April 2017. We collected data from 569 respondents, which corresponded to 2010 UGS locations. Our results show that resident's do not have equitable accessibility to UGS, caused by the uneven distribution of green spaces within the city. We also found that the number of residents traveling for UGS outside their zip area (outflux)was significantly related to the green space coverage and vegetation heterogeneity in their own zip area. We found no significant relation between resident's outflux and their sociodemographic characteristics. Our regression model determines that to have less than 50% of outflux Mediterranean cities need to have at least 25% of green space in a zip area. These results can support planners and decision-makers by providing guidance on how to identify areas of unequal accessibility and where to allocate efforts. © 2019 Elsevier GmbH","Centre for Ecology, Evolution and Environmental Changes (cE3c), Faculdade de Ciências, Universidade de Lisboa, Campo Grande, Lisboa 1749-016, Portugal

21,22,"Addressing the gaps between theory, research and practice, this paper explores a hybrid mindset of participatory action research (PAR), geoprospective and participatory geographical information system (PGIS). This approach brings together stakeholders, policy-makers and researchers - in an agricultural peri-urban region of Portugal, the Lezíria do Tejo region - to anticipate the possible changes in agricultural territories, while taking spatial dynamics into account. It uses a four-step methodology which integrates qualitative and quantitative approaches to select stakeholders' interview areas, implement prospective workshops to engage and explore the stakeholders' interests and encourage actions towards finding solutions for long-term agricultural sustainability in this region. The results from our study highlight that more participative approaches such as the ones developed here must be implemented towards decision-making, since they help to dispel the distrust between stakeholders, strengthen community cohesion and also contribute to build common solutions drawing upon various perspectives. From a PAR perspective, this work contributes to bridge the gap between academia and practitioners, as is shown by a willingness of the practitioners to actively participate in the research under progress.","CEG, IGOT, Universidade de Lisboa, Portugal

However, the effect of spatial scale on values and perceptions of green open spaces has, to date, received little attention. This study explored the influence of spatial scale using Public Participation GIS (PPGIS) methods in the Lower Hunter region of Australia. By asking respondents to assign markers denoting various values and preferences to green spaces displayed on maps of their suburb and municipality, the influence of scale was assessed experimentally. A greater abundance and diversity of value markers were consistently assigned at the suburb scale, yet this pattern was more pronounced for some values (e.g. physical activity) than others (e.g. nature, cultural significance). The strength of this relationship was related to socio-demographic variables such as education and income.

190,191,"Coral reefs provide important ecological services such as biodiversity, climate regulation, and cultural benefits through recreation and tourism. However, many of the world's reefs are declining, with Caribbean reefs suffering a significant decline in living corals over the past half century. This situation emphasizes the need to assess and monitor reef conditions using a variety of methods. In this study, a new method for assessing reef conditions to inform management using participatory mapping by coral reef “experts” in the U.S. Virgin Islands (USVI) is described. Occupational SCUBA divers were recruited (n=87) to map coral reef conditions, uses, and threats (stressors) using an internet-based mapping website. The data reveal an uneven geographic distribution of reef conditions in the USVI with the most frequently mapped perceived healthy reef characteristics being: large amount of physical reef structure (n=872 markers); endangered or threatened species present (n=721); and large amount of live coral cover (n=615). The greatest perceived threats were: invasive species (n=606); water pollution (n=234); and unsustainable fishing (n=200). Areas of important reef characteristics, perceived threats to reefs, and perceived recovery potential were plotted to identify areas requiring critical management attention. The authors found that perceptions of healthy reef conditions outnumbered perceptions of reef threats for nine of the ten most familiar coral reefs; the most frequent activity type within the coral reefs was tourism diving; and for the most familiar coral reefs, the divers perceived a high recovery potential. Given the novelty of participatory mapping methods to assess coral reefs, the strengths and weaknesses of the method is evaluated. The authors further propose a management typology for categorizing reef areas to inform their future management.

143,144,"Sustainable rangeland management is crucial for maintaining forage resources in pastoral systems, globally. However, pastoral regions are often remote and therefore data poor when it comes to resource monitoring. We tested participatory mapping as a means to rapidly assess rangeland use to identify areas with high grazing pressure. Participatory geographic information system data and herbaceous biomass production data were collected and georeferenced to establish a grazing pressure index for a summer pasture in the Mongolian Altay; simultaneously, a survey on herder perceptions and their recommended rangeland management measures was conducted. Areas with intense use, such as campsites and small and bovine ruminant grazing areas, corresponded with low biomass production and were found to be unsustainably grazed, likely prone to rangeland degradation. Participatory mapping was well received by herders and proved to be an effective method to appraise their herds' impact on rangeland resources. The process incited discussion and awareness regarding not only spatial, but also temporal aspects of rangeland management. Participatory mapping is thus a valuable tool that should be incorporated into local management initiatives in order to quickly monitor rangeland use for creating feasible management plans. © 2018 by the authors.","Animal Husbandry in the Tropics and Subtropics, University of Kassel and Georg-August-Universität Göttingen, Albrecht-Thaer-Weg 3, Göttingen, 37075, Germany

Focusing on a particularly segregated part of the city, this study uses state-of-the-art participatory geographic information systems (PGIS) and visualization techniques to create qualitative, bottom-up maps of segregation and sharing within the city, as experienced by the people who live there. In doing so, it identifies important and previously unreported patterns in segregation and sharing between sectarian communities, challenging normative approaches to PGIS and illustrating how alternative methods might provide deeper insights into complex social geographies such as those of segregation. Finally, the findings of this work are formulated into a set of hypotheses that can contribute to a future research agenda into segregation and sharing, both in Belfast and in other divided cities. © 2018, © 2018 by American Association of Geographers.","Department of Geography, University of Manchester, United Kingdom

108,109,"The Florida Keys is recognized as the birth place of flats fishing, but the flats fishery has historically been underappreciated by resource managers because it is a catch and release fishery. However, the fishery is increasingly threatened by habitat degradation and user conflicts. Ongoing regulatory revisions in the Florida Keys prompted us to work with flats fishing guides to document spatial fishing coverage and habitats so that this information could be included in management revisions. We used a geostatistical approach to create contour maps depicting fishing coverage and habitats, and provided this information to resource managers. This participatory GIS approach engages stakeholders in the management process, uses their knowledge of the resource, and contributes to resource and fisheries conservation. This study, in combination with research on the economic impact of the flats fishery, presents the flats fishery as an important conservation tool for the region and underscores the implication of relationships between researchers and data providers in the saltwater recreational fishery. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Bonefish & Tarpon Trust, P.O.

29,30,"Even though global interest in mangrove research has increased in recent years, unveiling their immense ecological and economic roles, very little work has been done to investigate the primary driving factors motivating long-term community-based mangrove restoration and management on local scales. In Ghana, policy makers and coastal management practitioners have recently embraced the concept of community-based and co-management of coastal and marine resources. Community-based and co-management approaches require that key stakeholders, most notably the resource users themselves, play significant roles and responsibilities in the management process. However, there is little evaluation of the process in Ghana to assess the success or otherwise, particularly of the few and long standing examples of community-based approaches in coastal resource management. With special reference to an over two decade old community-based mangrove forestry programme along the Volta estuary of Ghana, this paper provides concepts for examination of the ecological and socioeconomic factors influencing mangrove restoration and management by fishers, fish mongers, farmers and their socioeconomic groupings. Participatory GIS mapping and the use of orthophotos generated for the period 1974-2011 provided additional information on temporal evolution of the extent of mangrove areas restored and managed by local stakeholders. Socioeconomic assessment of mangrove products utility was done through questionnaire interviews. The results indicate that livelihoods and economic benefits are the primary factors that motivate local stakeholders' participation in mangrove restoration and management. Mangroves provisioning services, markets and low livelihoods diversification are major drivers of mangrove resources exploitation. The study has shown that mangroves resources can be sustainably exploited, restored and managed if local customary rules are enforced and institutional arrangements put in place to mediate mangrove exploitation and regeneration rates. Such an approach if well developed, could promote coastal resources conservation with high economic returns for the users. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Department of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences, University of Cape Coast, Cape Coast, Ghana

26,27,"This article presents results of an empirical study about the use of a group-based geographic information system (GIS), called WaterGroup, developed as a collaborative spatial decision support system. WaterGroup was designed to enable stakeholder groups to participate in the solution of conjunctive water resource administration decision problems being addressed by the Idaho Department of Water Resources in the Boise River Basin of southwestern Idaho. The decision situation, software development, and empirical investigation are described within the context of other research activities/literatures related to group/ community/public geographic information systems, helping us sort through the burgeoning terminology of this continually emerging field. We used Enhanced Adaptive Structuration Theory 2 to motivate research questions investigated by way of a field experiment research design. Decision process is characterized in terms of human-computer-human interaction coding. We used a technique called ""interaction coding"" to compile three streams of data from videotapes as a record of interaction in two stakeholder-oriented decision workshops. Coded data are examined using nonparametric, exploratory sequential data analysis. Additionally, we used questionnaires to gather data regarding participant perceptions of WaterGrou p and the decision process. The findings of this study indicate that different technology configurations foster a different balance between analytic and deliberative activities within phases of a conjunctive administration decision process. A low-technology, chauffeur-driven configuration in a phase encourages more deliberation, and a medium-technology, participant-driven configuration in a phase encourages more analysis. We discuss the findings and their implications for group-based GIS decision support.

30,31,"Assuring equal accessibility to public outdoor and recreation services is important because of the potential health and social welfare implications. The focus has primarily been on parks and other green spaces but should be expanded to include also the aquatic environments and the numerous recreational opportunities they have to offer. As the accessibility standards and approaches on ensuring equal accessibility to green spaces are often based on purely spatial measurements, this research examined the equality of accessibility of aquatic environments by combining spatio-temporal dimensions of accessibility with person-based measures. Public Participation GIS (PPGIS) method used in the study provided multifaceted knowledge on the person-based accessibility patterns related to aquatic environments in Helsinki Metropolitan Area, Finland. This paper demonstrates how an advanced GIS-based analysis combining both objective and subjective measurements of accessibility can result in more detailed and even contradictory outcomes compared to traditional spatial measures. The results indicate that a common presumption of a nearest service available made in studies on accessibility and environmental justice may have notable impacts on results or even return unfounded interpretations. Results also indicate that there are significant (p<. 0.05) differences in accessibility in the study region related to income status and car ownership. We conclude that PPGIS approaches can provide valuable information to accessibility research, studies on environmental justice and provide additional approaches for the planning and management officials of public recreation and outdoor services. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Department of Real Estate, Planning and Geoinformatics, Aalto University, PO Box 12200, Aalto, 00076, Finland

153,154,"Mining can have a notable environmental and social footprint both during the production phase and after the mine closure. We examined local stakeholders' viewpoints on two post-mining areas in northern Finland, Hannukainen and Rautuvaara, using a public participation geographic information system (PPGIS) approach. Spatially explicit data on local residents' and visitors' values, knowledge needs, and future perspectives on mining landscapes were collected with an online map-based survey tool (Harava). The results show that post-mining sites were generally considered unpleasant places. A majority of respondents were of the opinion that areas would need better reclamation and landscaping measures. The landscape surrounding the post-mining sites contained a wide diversity of pleasant places with high nature and recreational value. Respondents addressed various environmental concerns related to the impacts of former mining activities on the quality of ground water and surface water, potential soil contamination, and the safety of natural products. Opinions on the planned mine reopening were strongly divided among the respondents. One of the key questions was whether a large open-pit mine and nature-based tourism can coexist in the same region. Our results highlight that ""the shadow of the mine""-observed environmental impacts, uncertainties related to the spatial extent, duration, and magnitude of impacts, and knowledge gaps-can affect local stakeholders' land use far outside the mining sites and long after the mine closure. Identifying and mapping stakeholder values, opinions, and knowledge needs could significantly improve post-mining land use planning and mitigate the loss of multifunctional landscapes. © 2018 by the authors.","Department of Geographical and Historical Studies, University of Eastern Finland, P.O.

169,170,"Addressing environmental governance conflicts requires the adoption of a complexity approach to carry out an adaptive process of collective learning, exploration, and experimentation. In this article, we hypothesize that by integrating community-based participatory mapping processes with internet-based collaborative digital mapping technologies, it is possible to create tools and spaces for knowledge co-production and collective learning. We also argue that providing a collaborative web platform enables these projects to become a repository of activist knowledge and practices that are often poorly stored and barely shared across communities and organizations. The collaborative Webmap of Water Conflicts in Andalusia, Spain, is used to show the benefits and potential of mapping processes of this type. The article sets out the steps and methods used to develop this experience: (i) background check; (ii) team discussion and draft proposal; (iii) in-depth interviews, and (iv) integrated participative and collaborative mapping approach. The main challenge that had to be addressed during this process was to co-create a tool able to combine the two perspectives that construct the identity of integrated mapping: a data-information-knowledge co-production process that is useful for the social agents-the environmental activists-while also sufficiently categorizable and precise to enable the competent administrations to steer their water management. © 2020 by the authors.

The community map presented in this paper is built on participatory mapping and Participatory GIS practices (especially photo mapping) and links to advanced spatial analysis in the context of disaster risk reduction and flood hazard assessment. Based on a very high-resolution satellite imagery, community members mapped different features such as the community boundary, settlement areas and their names, agricultural areas, important infrastructure and most importantly 'low' and 'high risk' zones for floods. It has been for the first time that a community was mapped in Mozambique in such a way integrating local knowledge. The identification of hazard zones in a participatory manner was seen as one way to overcome the bottleneck of limited available data for a proper GIS-based hazard modeling. Next to the digitization of the community mapped features, an image classification on land use, settlement areas (houses), and the integration of GPS collected points (infrastructure, photos) was carried out. In a final step the map was printed and handed-over to the community members. In the applied methodology it has been demonstrated that the assessment of risks through the integration of community knowledge and paper-based satellite images is valid. Next to the result of deriving a community-based hazard map, the process of mapping is understood as essential to sensitize and learn about local flood hazard risk. © 2014 © 2014 Stefan Kienberger.","University of Salzburg, Z-GIS, Salzburg, Austria",,2014,vulnerability,Journal of Maps,"Participatory mapping of flood hazard risk in Munamicua, District of Búzi, Mozambique"

This work provides a new perspective, using methodologies not normally associated with SUDS research, to determine multiple benefits.

178,179,"Land use in many areas is highly contested. An understanding of the nature of such conflicts, and of spatial variation in their intensity, is required to develop planning solutions. We present a novel process for attaining these outcomes which involves mapping of values and potential conflict between stakeholders determined using participatory GIS (PGIS) processes. Our starting point was an a priori identification of the values that were potentially in conflict. We produced quantitative and qualitative maps of each of the values that formed a basis for workshop discussion among small stakeholder groups. Each participant was asked to complete a questionnaire to determine their values and their attitudes to land use and to map the places that they would not be prepared to lose. Principal components analysis was used to identify the major independent axes in values and attitudes among all participants. We then used repeatable descriptive quantitative procedures to identify attitude groups. These analyses allowed us to identify potential conflicts between values that could be expressed in land use, spatial variation in attachment of groups and the intensity of potential conflict. In our test of the process in the Tarkine region of Tasmania, Australia, we found that land use conflict was multidimensional, involving incompatible recreational activities and incompatibility between nature conservation and economic production. Two-fifths of the area was shown to be not in contest, with considerable spatial variation in the intensity of conflict potential in the remainder. This latter variation could facilitate a process of land use compromise. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Rural Clinical School, University of Tasmania, Locked Bag 3513, Burnie, TAS 7320, Australia

161,162,"Context: Local scale assessments of ecosystem/landscape services in Africa are insufficient and lack relevance in landscape management. Also, few studies have explored the potential benefits of PGIS/PPGIS approaches for landscape management and stewardship among the participating stakeholders. Objectives: Our aim is (1) to establish an understanding of the realization of landscape services at the local scale across three multifunctional rural landscapes in Tanzania through PGIS/PPGIS approaches and (2) to create an understanding of these approaches’ potential to support participatory spatial planning. Methods: Semi-structured surveys (n = 313) including participatory mapping of provisioning and cultural landscape services were organised to characterise their spatial patterns. The survey results were shared with the communities (n = 97) in workshops where services were ranked and the participants interviewed about their map-reading capacity, personal learning experiences, and their ability to use maps to express opinions. Results: The most abundant landscape services are sites for social gatherings and cultivation. The spatial patterns of provisioning services are realizations of human benefits from the patterns of the biophysical landscape. Overall, cultural landscape services show clustering and small spatial extent (except aesthetics). The PGIS/PPGIS approach allows for local-level, spatially specific discussions between stakeholders. The visual power of maps and satellite images is particularly emphasised. Conclusion: In the data-scarce context common in the Global South, the participatory mapping of landscape services has the potential to advance understanding of the benefits that the landscape has for the local communities and how this information, when mapped spatially, can be integrated with local-level planning practices. © 2019, The Author(s).","Department of Geography and Geology, University of Turku, Turku, 20014, Finland

83,84,"Subsistence resources are critical for indigenous communities in the Kotzebue Sound region of NW Alaska. Global sea-level rise (SLR) and coastal erosion are likely to create unfavorable and hazardous conditions for coastal and estuarine settlements. It is unclear how SLR and erosion might affect coastal subsistence resources because of highly complex ecological interactions. This study integrates physical, anthropological, and survey data to assess coastal vulnerability and to identify areas of concern for local and regional planning and environmental protection. This study analyzes and integrates historical and projected physical coastal changes within the Kotzebue Sound region with (1) a coastal vulnerability index (CVI); (2) community-based participatory GIS maps of community subsistence resources; and (3) representative surveys of local communities to determine the importance of each type of resource. The results identify Kivalina and Deering as particularly vulnerable coastal locations among four studied villages. While the CVI is high in these locations, low erosion rates will not likely have any negative impact on fish and caribou-two of the most important subsistence resource species for these communities. Because of the higher number of identified subsistence resource species, Deering is more resilient than Kivalina to any potential negative coastal impacts. This methodology can be useful in other coastal areas where subsistence resources play a major part in people's lives. © 2014 Coastal Education & Research Foundation.","Department of Earth, Environmental and Geospatial Sciences, Lehman College, City University of New York (CUNY), West Bronx, NY 10468, United States

69,70,"Recent findings have shown that minority communities are frequently underserved by green infrastructure developments relative to non-minority communities, as local installations of green infrastructure often follow patterns of gentrification. Antipathy from these communities toward existing environmental management efforts present further obstacles related to green infrastructure placement. While hydrologic modeling has been highly utilized in decision support for green infrastructure placement, this technique does not consider ownership, access concerns, or the importance of visibility. Alternatively, participatory geographic information systems (PPGIS) can provide a different perspective from hydrologic models, as they have the potential to forecast community perceptions of green infrastructure utility, rather than hydrological benefit. We use a mixed-methods approach to optimize green infrastructure site-selection that considers hydrologic vulnerabilities in the context of place-based knowledge and historical realities. Residents’ perceptions of the locations of nuisance flooding were reported via participatory mapping within a paper-based survey (n = 95) conducted in the communities surrounding Walnut Creek, a historically African-American community in Raleigh, North Carolina. Hotspot analysis was used to identify statistically significant clustering, which was related to a correspondence between participant-indicated nuisance flooding sites and high flow accumulation cells. Comparison of the participatory and hydrologic hotspot analyses show some geospatial overlap for potential green infrastructure placement. We propose that, when undertaken with community input, green infrastructure installation in these downstream areas may help offset localized flooding patterns while facilitating greater trust with stormwater and environmental practitioners. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","North Carolina State University, Department of Forestry and Environmental Resources, United States

241,242,"Maintaining urban greenspace is important for stimulating diverse human-nature interactions. Yet, which greenspace to prioritize for conservation under threat of urban densification is a major planning challenge. Besides ecological knowledge and objective use, people's subjective perception or opinion of urban greenspace has been emphasized in assessing the conservation value of urban greenspace and guiding present-day urban planning. Better understanding on people's perception of urban greenspace and its influencing factors are, therefore, needed. Here we employ a Public Participatory Geographic Information System (PPGIS) survey on “unique urban nature” in the city of Helsinki to explore people's perceived uniqueness (i.e., perceived conservation value) of urban forest patches. We use generalized linear modeling (GLM) and structural equation modeling (SEM) to estimate the relationship between this perceived uniqueness and measurable conservation factors, specifically four biodiversity indicators (BDIs) and seven environmental factors characterizing vegetation structure, landscape features and urban context of the forest patch. Results show that biodiversity has a strong positive impact on perceived uniqueness (PU), while environmental factors have variable impacts on PU, either directly or indirectly through their impacts on biodiversity. While the size and surrounding population density of an urban forest are positively correlated with both biodiversity and PU, its connectivity, surrounding constructed land-use, and canopy cover exhibit negative correlations with PU. Our results highlight the importance of biodiversity in affecting PU both as a direct influencing factor and as a mediator of the impact of environmental factors. We detected distinct effects of environmental factors (e.g., connectivity, canopy cover) on biodiversity and PU, implying different responses of biodiversity and PU to these factors, and a potential trade-off between biodiversity (natural conservation value) and people's conservation value when managing urban forests. © 2019 Elsevier GmbH","Faculty of Biological and Environmental Sciences, University of Helsinki00014, Finland",,2019,Urban forest,Urban Forestry and Urban Greening,"What makes urban greenspace unique – Relationships between citizens’ perceptions on unique urban nature, biodiversity and environmental factors"
82,83,"Critical knowledge gaps seriously hinder efforts for building disaster resilience at all levels, especially in disaster-prone least developed countries. Information deficiency is most serious at local levels, especially in terms of spatial information on risk, resources, and capacities of communities. To tackle this challenge, we develop a general methodological approach that integrates community-based participatory mapping processes, one that has been widely used by governments and non-government organizations in the fields of natural resources management, disaster risk reduction and rural development, with emerging collaborative digital mapping techniques. We demonstrate the value and potential of this integrated participatory and collaborative mapping approach by conducting a pilot study in the flood-prone lower Karnali river basin in Western Nepal. The process engaged a wide range of stakeholders and non-stakeholder citizens to co-produce locally relevant geographic information on resources, capacities, and flood risks of selected communities. The new digital community maps are richer in content, more accurate, and easier to update and share than those produced by conventional Vulnerability and Capacity Assessments (VCAs), a variant of Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA), that is widely used by various government and non-government organizations. We discuss how this integrated mapping approach may provide an effective link between coordinating and implementing local disaster risk reduction and resilience building interventions to designing and informing regional development plans, as well as its limitations in terms of technological barrier, map ownership, and empowerment potential. © 2018 by the authors.

46,47,"Background: Children's habitual physical activity, including active travel and catching public transit (walking and cycling to and from destinations), and independent mobility (mobility without an adult) have decreased. Public transit trips are physically active and can provide access to hobbies independent of parents, but there is no device-measured data about children's total physical activity time following the introduction of free public transit. Our aim is to compare physical activity and independent mobility between children living in two Finnish towns, one with a recently introduced free public transit system, and the other without free public transit. Methods: The city of Mikkeli has provided free public transit for all comprehensive school children since 2017. Various districts from Mikkeli, and the reference town of Kouvola (towns from South-Eastern Finland with a comparative population size and geographical structure), are selected based on their accessibility and the availability of public transit services. Samples of 10-12-year-old children will be recruited through primary schools. We will compare moderate-to-vigorous physical activity time, sitting time (a thigh-worn Fibion® device) and independent mobility (a participatory mapping method, PPGIS) of children: 1) who live in towns with and without free public transit, 2) who live and go to school in districts with high vs. low perceived and objective access to free public transit, and 3) who report using vs. not using free public transit. In addition, ethnography will be used to get insights on the social and cultural effects of the free public transit on children's and parent's everyday life. Discussion: There is a need for scalable solutions that can increase children's physical activity independent of their socioeconomic background or place of residence. This project will give information on how a political action to provide free public transit for children is associated with their total physical activity time and independent mobility patterns, therefore providing highly relevant information for political decision-making and for promoting independent physical activity in children. © 2020 The Author(s).","Active Life Lab, South-Eastern Finland University of Applied Sciences, Raviradantie 22b, Mikkeli, 50100, Finland

60,61,"The management of recreation areas can presumably affect visitors experiences by altering the settings where experiences are constructed. Thus, several methodological approaches have been used in the past to explore the relationship between recreation setting and experiences. Most of these approaches have ignored spatial aspects of experiences. This study explores a participatory mapping technique, as one form of Public Participation GlS (PPGIS), to examine recreation satisfaction in Oulanka National Park (ONP). The applied mapping technique asked visitors to mark on a paper map where they had the highest and lowest quality experiences in ONP and to explain why. The study shows that positive and negative experiences are spatially clustered and often concentrate in the same locations within the park.

These positive experiences are dominated by perceptions of scenery, while recreation facilities are often the reasons for dissatisfactory experiences.

157,158,"Climate change is affecting human and geophysical systems in a variety of complex and interdependent ways. For nature-based tourism-dependent communities like those along the North Shore of Lake Superior in Minnesota, impacts to the region's abundant natural resources can subsequently affect the livelihoods of individuals who depend upon those resources to provide essential ecosystem services and support the region's economy. Many of the area's natural and outdoor recreation resources are collaboratively managed, making cooperation essential to address climate change impacts. In this study, we engaged North Shore stakeholders in a climate change risk assessment process through an exploratory application of participatory geographic information systems (PGIS). Stakeholder involvement allows for the co-production of science to deliver locally-relevant data and information. Involving stakeholders through a PGIS-based climate change risk assessment process allows locally-relevant data and information to be represented and visualized spatially. We used PGIS focus groups, as well as pre- and post-surveys, to solicit stakeholders' perceptions of risk thresholds (i.e., the time scale of impacts) and climate-related risk severity to sites with built infrastructure, natural amenities, and recreation and tourism destinations. The stakeholders' knowledge, as well as their commitment to their communities and local environments, influenced general perceptions of region-wide climate-related vulnerabilities. The PGIS exercises generated important discussion among stakeholders and shed light on how to more efficiently collect spatially-explicit data and information from stakeholders that can be used to inform mitigation and adaptation efforts. © 2019 by the authors.","Department of Parks, Recreation and Tourism Management, NC State University, Raleigh, NC 27695, United States

67,68,"Over the last years, geospatial web platforms, social media, and volunteered geographic information (VGI) have opened a window of opportunity for traditional Public Participatory GIS (PPGIS) to usher in a new era. Taking advantage of these technological achievements, this paper presents a new approach for a citizen-orientated framework of spatial planning that aims at integrating participatory community work into existing decision-making structures. One major cornerstone of the presented approach is the application of a social geoweb platform (the GeoCitizen platform) that combines geo-web technologies and social media in one single tool allowing citizens to collaboratively report observations, discuss ideas, solve, and monitor problems in their living environment at a local level. This paper gives an account of an ongoing participatory land-zoning process in the Capital District of Quito, Ecuador, where the GeoCitizen platform is applied in a long-term study. © 2014 The Author(s).","Department of Geoinformatics - Z-GIS, Doctoral College GIScience, University Salzburg, Hellbrunnerstrasse 34, 5020 Salzburg, Austria

The conceptual and operational research axes were interdisciplinary environmental geography and integrative concept landscape. A participatory geographic information system (PGIS) was built to incorporate scientific and local knowledge. Regional landscape changes were analysed in fishing communities of the Mexican North Pacific, based on three historical maps. The main land- and seascape changes were: extensive stockbreeding disappeared; intensive agriculture increased; human settlements expanded; and fishing zones were created, divided and expanded seawards. Marine environment was the most changeable territory, reflecting the dominance of fishing activities. The PGIS proved to be a useful tool for identifying and understanding the changes in fishery management and the resulting dynamics of marine landscape zoning in the various communities, and in future projects would be equally applicable to coastal management and territorial organisation. © 2015 Landscape Research Group Ltd.","Instituto de Investigaciones Oceanológicas, UABC, Ensenada, Mexico

218,219,"Spatially-explicit participatory planning is a relatively new approach for managing visitors to protected areas. In this study we used public participation geographic information systems (PPGIS) mapping and global positioning system (GPS) tracking to monitor mountain bikers frequenting national parks for tourism and recreation in Northern Sydney, Australia. PPGIS was implemented using both an internet application and with hardcopy maps in the field. Our research addressed two fundamental questions for park planning: (1) What is the spatial distribution of visitor activities and location-specific reasons for riding; and (2) What location-specific actions are needed to improve riding experiences? The spatial distributions of riding activities generated in PPGIS showed strong correlation with the GPS tracking results, with riding locations being related to the reasons for track selection. Riders proposed a broad range of management actions to improve riding experiences. PPGIS mapping provides a cost-effective approach to facilitate spatial decision making, allowing park agencies to prioritise future visitor management actions.

One growing area of community-based research focuses on geographic examinations of aspects of social service accessibility. In this study, we work with multiple community partners in an urban area to examine the spatial distribution of social service providers. We also identify potential new locations for social service providers that can meet the unmet demands for such services. We utilize a Public Participation GIS framework to create shared community resources and research deliverables for our community partners. The results of our work help local providers, leaders, and community residents to visualize gaps and coverage in social services across urban space; draw attention to additional forces that shape access, i.e. public transportation, walkability, and zoning codes; and confirm the anecdotal evidence of poor accessibility presented by neighborhood leaders and residents.

88,89,"The increasing sophistication of classification techniques used in land use and land cover analysis has not been matched by attention to the origin and effects of land cover categories. While classifications appear unproblematic and self-evident, they carry with them their own histories, meanings and effects, which remain largely unexamined. In an effort at such scrutiny, we examine the origins of land cover categories deployed in remote sensing and conclude that categories are theory-laden metaphors and occur epistemologically prior to any clustering algorithm, no matter how sophisticated. We describe the problematic effects that the imposition of classification systems in place of in situ knowledge of the landscape can have, especially in a colonial or post-colonial context. As an alternative to imposed classification, we propose and demonstrate an empirical technique based upon a growing body of work in participatory GIS. The method compares image classifications based on local and expert knowledge, using a case study from Rajasthan, India, concluding that differing metaphors of landscape lead to divergent measures of land cover.","Department of Geography, Ohio State University, 1132 Derby Hall, Columbus, OH 43210, United States","Robbins, P.",2000,,Cartography and Geographic Information Science,Interrogating land cover categories: Metaphor and method in remote sensing
231,232,"Spatial or GIS-based Multicriteria Decision Analysis (GIS-MCDA) incorporates a mixed set of theories, methods and tools in order to combine geospatial data with decision makers' judgments for the purpose of generating information required in spatial decision making. However, given the complex nature of spatial decision making processes, contradicting preferences of experts regarding the proper evaluation criteria to be used as well as uncertainty of inputs, the GIS-MCDA results may not be perfectly matched with the community preferences. Consequently, ensuring that the outcomes of decision-making processes are indeed consistent with the needs, values and preferences of the public is of critical importance. Accordingly, this study proceeds to employ Public Participation GIS (PPGIS) or citizen-generated information as reference data to validate the results of GIS-MCDA processes. This validation is carried out by means of certain spatial indices including total coverage, geometric intersection, central distances and statistical indices. To this end, the issue of selecting the optimal sites for the establishment of restaurants in Babolsar, Mazandaran province, was selected as the case study. The study proceeded by initially determining the optimal locations of restaurants based on expert opinion and via the GISbased Best-Worst multicriteria method. Next, a Web-based PPGIS tool was designed and implemented, enabling citizens to draw the optimal sites for restaurant establishment. Finally, the optimal locations determined via the multicriteria method (in three suitable, moderate and unsuitable classes) were compared and validated with PPGIS in accordance with the corresponding spatial indices. Although the suitable class of the GIS-MCDA output map (expert-derived restaurant sites), indicating preferences of experts, had the highest level of complete coverage (0.1%) and intersection (2.6%) with PPGIS (citizen-derived restaurant sites) as opposed to the other two classes, the validation results indicate a rather low level of consistency between experts' solution and citizen opinions in the designation of proper sites for the establishment of restaurants.",,"Vanolya, N.

32,33,"A distinguishing feature of conservation planning and analysis methods is that they generally rely on biological assessments carried out using scientific sampling protocols and methodologies. Few conservation planning methods explicitly include what is variably described as values, understanding and perceptions. In this study, we examine the potential use of local values of biological resources in conservation planning by comparing this with scientific biological assessment of the same region, using the example of Prince William Sound, Alaska (USA). Specifically, we compare the spatial coincidence of local perceptions of biological importance (or value) identified in a survey of Alaska residents with biologically significant areas identified by scientists familiar with the area from a marine conservation workshop. The results indicate a moderate degree of spatial coincidence between local values and scientific assessment with obvious geographic areas of agreement and disagreement. We suggest that incorporation of local perceptions of biological importance can complement and strengthen scientific biological assessments and propose an iterative conservation planning process that includes both methodologies. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

44,45,"Sustainability of urban transportation and residents' daily mobility is increasingly important for the future of urban regions. In this paper, we present a novel methodology combining mapped survey responses (gathered using public participation GIS) and sophisticated multimodal routing analysis to understand patterns of suburban residents' daily mobility. Our particular focus is on residents' mode choices and their optimality in terms of travel time. We also examine the carbon-intensity of potential mode choice mismatches where a comparatively slower travel mode is chosen for a particular trip. This paper shows how the combination of the two data sources create new possibilities for analysing daily mobility by enabling the comparison of self-reported, geographically referenced mobility patterns and modelled, objectively ""optimal"" patterns. Our case study results from a rapidly growing metropolitan area, Greater Helsinki in Finland, indicate that people have rather sustainable daily mobility practices. Their daily trips are typically short (median 1.8 km), and non-motorised travel modes are the most popular. Also the share of car travel is significant. While public transport clearly has the lowest modal share, it is frequently used on longer trips to destinations where public transport connections are good (particularly the city centre). In 44% of trips, the respondents choose the fastest travel mode. When a comparatively slower travel mode is chosen, it most often produces less CO2 emissions than the fastest mode. However, particularly on shopping trips - the most commonly reported type of trip - car driving dominates as the fastest means of transportation. When a slower mode is chosen on a shopping trip, it is typically more carbon-intensive than the fastest mode would have been in that case. The methodology presented here can be used to support local decision making, particularly when daily services and transport infrastructure are planned or reorganised. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Department of Geosciences and Geography, University of Helsinki, P.O.

Using an internet-based public participation geographic information system (PPGIS) system, study participants identified the spatial locations where they engaged in various types of physical activity and where they received other park benefits-environmental, social, and psychological health benefits. Using an urban park typology, we found that different urban park types provide different opportunities for physical activity with linear parks providing the greatest overall physical benefit while other park types provided important non-physical community benefits. Distance to park was not a significant predictor of physical activity but park size was correlated with physical activity and other park benefits.

233,234,"The remote Kimberley region in Western Australia presents a unique nature-based tourism destination. One of the world's last wildernesses, the Kimberley is one of the least-impacted marine environments in the world. Tourism in the region is growing rapidly, driven by stunning natural landscapes, unparalleled nature-based experiences and a vibrant indigenous culture. Despite this, there has been virtually no research into how stakeholders value the Kimberley and spatially explicit investigations are lacking. State marine protected area planning, currently in a formative stage in the region, requires such spatially explicit social data to complement existing biophysical information. This paper reports on findings from a Public Participation GIS survey with 206 stakeholders undertaken in 2015 as part of a broader research project into socio-cultural values and management preferences for the Kimberley coast. Stakeholders' spatially linked values were collected via an internet-based mapping survey for the purpose of supporting future planning and management in the region. Stakeholders mapped over 4,100 value locations, with values relating to scenery/aesthetics, recreational fishing, Aboriginal culture and nature-based tourism being most prominent. Analysis identified a clear spatial clustering of values across the region with a number of value 'hotspots' evident. Tourism planners and managers can analyse these hotspots to identify areas of potential congruence and conflict, thus assisting in retaining the qualities of the region that support ongoing tourism. By generating spatially explicit information on stakeholder values and areas of importance, this research makes an important contribution to tourism planning and management in the Kimberley. © 2016 WIT Press, www.witpress.com.","Murdoch University, Australia

Unfortunately, most of the studies aimed to evaluate and map cultural ecosystem services (CES) are not used for actual decision support therefore there is a gap in the literature about its use in practice. This study aimed to reduce this gap by: (i) mapping CES perceived by city park users through participatory mapping (PPGIS); (ii) mapping CES arising from park management (management perception); (iii) comparing citizens and park management perception to identify matches or mismatches; and (iv) discussing the utility of the data acquired and the methodology proposed to inform urban planning. The methodology presented in this study resulted in data directly informative for urban planning. It provided spatially explicit data about perceived cultural services of the park as well as information about the matching or mismatching patterns about cultural services provision comparing the users' view with the management dimension. This research demonstrated a way to use the potential of ES mapping to inform urban planning and explored the local management demand for CES mapping, showing this to be a valuable tool for effective integration into actual decision making. © 2017 by the authors.","Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences, University of Milano-Bicocca, piazza della Scienza 1, Milano, 20126, Italy

68,69,"Background: Evaluating fuel treatment effectiveness is challenging when managing a landscape for diverse ecological, social, and economic values. We used a Participatory Geographic Information System (PGIS) to understand Confederated Colville Tribal (CCT) member views regarding the location and effectiveness of fuel treatments within their ancestral territory within the Colville National Forest (CNF) boundary. The 2015 North Star Fire burned 88 221 ha (218 000 acres) of the CCT ancestral territory. Results: We sampled thirty plot pairs that were treated or untreated prior to being burned by the North Star Fire and again one growing season post fire. Species diversity was significantly increased by wildfire in both treated and untreated plots. Species richness was significantly increased in the plots that were treated, and there was no significant change in species richness from wildfire within the untreated plots. The percent canopy cover of two of the six culturally important plants (Fragaria spp. L. and Arnica cordifolia Hook.) significantly increased one growing season post wildfire within treated plots and one (Arctostaphylos uva-ursi [L.] Spreng.) significantly decreased in the treated plots post wildfire. These post-fire monitoring results were consistent with CCT member management recommendations and desired outcomes of understory thinning, prescribed fire, and natural ignition found using PGIS. Conclusions: Together, the results suggest that prior thinning and prescribed burning can foster vegetation response to subsequent wildfires, including culturally important plants. Further, integrating Traditional Knowledge (TK) into fuels treatments can improve ongoing adaptive management of national forests that include tribal ancestral lands. © 2019, The Author(s).","USDA Forest Service, Colville National Forest, 765 S.

Notwithstanding the central role of human agency in these approaches, it is recognised that many times marine management has not been effective in part due to a failure to use all available sources of information and knowledge, particularly the local knowledge of the resources' users. The transboundary Grenadine Islands, which rely heavily on the marine environment for livelihoods, provide an example of a complex system where there is a high diversity of uses and all available information is needed for effective management. We illustrate how a participatory GIS approach can be applied as a sound basis for practically incorporating an ecosystem approach within marine spatial planning initiatives. Key benefits include effective data management, increased spatial understanding and the definition of critical areas across the Grenada Bank. We found the application of a PGIS approach to support spatially-based ecosystem-level analyses of the Grenada Bank to be conducted and presented in ways that could be expected to increase stakeholder understanding of information generated thus supporting marine governance.","University of the West Indies, Jamaica",,2014,Transboundary grenadine islands,Electronic Journal of Information Systems in Developing Countries,A participatory GIS for marine spatial planning in the Grenadine Islands

76,77,"The terms NIMBY (Not-In-My-Back-Yard) and YIMBY (Yes-In-My-Back-Yard) describe negative and positive attitudes toward proposed development projects respectively. These attitudes are posited to be influenced by geographic (spatial) discounting wherein the distance from domicile may contribute to local opposition or support. In contrast to specific development projects, the potential influence of NIMBY/YIMBY in a general land use planning process has not been systematically evaluated. In this study, we analyzed empirical data from a public participation GIS (PPGIS) process implemented for a general plan revision to examine the evidence for geographic discounting for a range of land uses using mapped preferences by community residents. Using distance analysis, we found significant evidence for geographic discounting by land use type with variable discount rates influenced by location of residence and the spatial configuration of land use in the planning area represented by zoning. The findings were consistent with NIMBY/YIMBY expectations with the exception of residential development where the results were more ambiguous. Residents want future land uses with amenities (open space, recreation, and trails) closer to domicile and more intensive, developed land uses (commercial, tourism, events, parking) further away. The findings have potentially broad implications because general/comprehensive planning—a requirement of most local governments in the U.S.—is operationalized through land use zones that appear subject to spatial discounting and the manifestation of potential NIMBY/YIMBY effects in the planning process.

5,6,"Agricultural intensification has been the key in addressing the growing demand for food production both for home consumption and supplying the market. The market demand on agricultural production has therefore triggered change in land use. For farmers, it makes a lot of economic sense to venture on high value agricultural products where land and labor capital is limited This study provided a temporal analysis that would describe the land use changes in Barangay Songco, Lantapan, Bukidnon, with emphasis on the driving forces and how they influence the farming decision of farmers. Participatory mapping and focused group discussion were conducted with selected farmer-residents, and a satellite image to generate the historical land use map of barangay Songco. Maps were digitized and land areas were computed using the ArcGis9 field calculator to derive the estimated area occupied by a certain land use. Land use change in Songco is influenced by a high demand of agricultural products. Furthermore, inappropriate farming systems such as up and down planting that vegetable growers practice has caused severe soil erosion, leading to the decline on crop yield due to the removal of soil nutrients. Moreover, the off-site effect of soil erosion are siltation and sedimentation which carry traces of pesticides and chemical contaminants into water bodies which are likely to degrade water quality and may create health problems for farm families and those living downstream (Coxhead et. al. 2005).",,"Pailagao, C.

29,30,"Marine coastal environments are often socially complex public areas that need equitable spatial planning approaches. Understanding the extent of extractive and non-extractive uses and the social dynamics that may be driving patterns of use is essential if the spatial plan is to support the social resilience of a marine area. In this study, a combination of fuzzy-set multi-criteria GIS modelling and negative tie social network analysis were used to explore social uses and conflicts based on sketch-mapping interviews with five key stakeholder groups (ecotourism, Aboriginal Traditional Owners, commercial and recreational fishing, and water sports) within a Marine Protected Area (MPA). Most of the areas within the MPA were regularly used by the stakeholders, with non-extractive and extractive stakeholders occupying similar spatial extents, with each stakeholder group having a different pattern of use. However, stakeholder groups had different levels of perceived priority to access these areas and support of the current spatial management plan, especially within the ecotourism and Aboriginal Traditional Owner groups. The investigation of social conflicts in shaping patterns of use revealed that most stakeholder conflicts do not necessarily occur in areas of overlaps, but generally in areas of high biodiversity and easy access through marine infrastructure. Ecotourism groups had the most perceived conflicts over marine space, which shaped their use towards certain no-take zones that protected high biodiversity and would also provide protection from other conflicting stakeholder uses (e.g., boating, fishing). Overall, the method outlined in this paper presents a way for marine spatial management to consider not only the extent and diversity of social uses in a marine environment but also the spatial-social dynamics that may determine the success of the spatial plan in supporting long-term social resilience. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Fenner School of Environment and Society, The Australian National University, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia

15,16,"Satellite mapping contributes significantly to ecological studies of landscape composition and structure but needs to better engage local populations in more culturally sensitive assessments of diversity patterns. This study examines how participatory mapping can contribute to land-cover analyses derived from satellite data of landscapes in the Manaslu Conservation Area (MCA), Nepal. Landscapes were mapped by local residents, first on paper and again on a geo-registered Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) scene, for April 7, 2010. Local landscape knowledge from men and women was transferred from participatory maps to the classified satellite image to create an integrated landscape map for the MCA. Participatory maps added the significance of ""place"" to the evaluation of landscape diversity (n = 276 named places for women and 315 for men). The classification of the TM image resulted in seven land cover types with only 10% of the land classified as forests, which are highly fragmented. The final map combined local landscape knowledge (n = 43 places mapped on the TM image and n = 21 from the transect walks) with the empirical classification of land cover types, increasing the spatial understanding of MCA as a ""place"" of material use and cultural meaning. This integrative map, as process and outcome, promoted collaborative learning about local places and local peoples' perspectives on their landscape, which can contribute to more adaptive landscape planning and conservation of forest and livelihood resources. © 2016 Society of Ethnobiology.","Department of Biology, Miami University, Oxford, OH 45056, United States

18,19,"Background: Half of the population of Africa will soon live in towns and cities where it can be protected from malaria by controlling aquatic stages of mosquitoes. Rigorous but affordable and scaleable methods for mapping and managing mosquito habitats are required to enable effective larval control in urban Africa. Methods: A simple community-based mapping procedure that requires no electronic devices in the field was developed to facilitate routine larval surveillance in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. The mapping procedure included (1) community-based development of sketch maps and (2) verification of sketch maps through technical teams using laminated aerial photographs in the field which were later digitized and analysed using Geographical Information Systems (GIS). Results: Three urban wards of Dar es Salaam were comprehensively mapped, covering an area of 16.8 km2. Over thirty percent of this area were not included in preliminary community-based sketch mapping, mostly because they were areas that do not appear on local government residential lists. The use of aerial photographs and basic GIS allowed rapid identification and inclusion of these key areas, as well as more equal distribution of the workload of malaria control field staff. Conclusion: The procedure developed enables complete coverage of targeted areas with larval control through comprehensive spatial coverage with community-derived sketch maps. The procedure is practical, affordable, and requires minimal technical skills. This approach can be readily integrated into malaria vector control programmes, scaled up to towns and cities all over Tanzania and adapted to urban settings elsewhere in Africa. © 2007 Dongus et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","Department of Public Health and Epidemiology, Swiss Tropical Institute, Basel, Switzerland

32,33,"Participatory mapping of local land use as the basis for planning and decision-making has become widespread around the globe. However, still relatively little is known about the conceptual underpinnings of geographic information produced through participatory mapping in given cultural and linguistic settings. In this paper, we therefore address the seemingly simple question of what is (not) represented on maps through an exploratory case study comparing land use categories participants represented on sketch maps with categories elicited through more language-focused ethnographic fieldwork. To explore landscape categorization, we conducted sketch mapping with 29 participants and in-depth ethnographic fieldwork with 19 participants from the Takana indigenous people in the Bolivian Amazon. Sketch mapping resulted in 74 different feature types, while we elicited 156 landscape categories used in language, of which only 23 overlapped with feature types from the sketch mapping. Vegetation categories were highly diversified in language but seldom represented on maps, while more obviously anthropogenic features were represented on sketch maps. Furthermore, participants seldom drew culturally important landscape categories such as fallow plots or important plant harvesting sites on maps, with important potential consequences for natural resource management. © 2017 by the authors.","Geography Department, University of Zurich, Winterthurerstr. 190, Zurich, CH-8057, Switzerland

2,3,"It is recognized that participatory mapping techniques in the context of indigenous societies are fraught with dilemmas around the uneven distribution of power, differing understandings of boundaries drawn across the landscape, and incommensurable epistemologies of the human relationship with the environment. At the same time policy makers and practitioners recognize the value of local knowledge in planning and management practices, including for the planning and management of conservation areas. Mindful of this dilemma geographers and researchers in allied fields such as applied anthropology have tested participatory and inclusive mapping techniques across a variety of cultural contexts over the last several decades. This article evaluates the outcomes of a participatory conservation zoning exercise undertaken in a mineral extraction zone-the Cordillera Huayhuash-in the Andes of Central Peru and contributes a case study to this body of work. The principal method used was the construction of a manual 'GIS' upon which local communities could draw their zoning vision as an overlay on transparent acetate. The evaluation of the work focuses on the governance outcomes from the process rather than the map products that were drawn. The findings confirm that such processes are rife with the dilemmas identified in prior research, yet the zoning project also helped 'bridge' the great divide between the state and civil society by building trust through dialog. The findings also indicate that the chosen approach can be used as a ground truthing tool to identify accuracy and completeness problems in the cadastral database maintained by the government of Peru. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","UCSC Environmental Studies, 1156 High Street, Santa Cruz, CA 95064, United States",,2014,Private conservation,Applied Geography,"Bridging the great divide: State, civil society, and 'participatory' conservation mapping in a resource extraction zone"
114,115,"Tourism is a significant driver of social and ecological change in developing countries, particularly in small-island states, which are susceptible to tourism impacts due to their particular social and environmental characteristics. In this article we present a participatory mapping approach to obtaining spatially explicit local perceptions of future environmental and social change resulting from tourism development, as well as addressing the different community conflicts that may arise through the introduction of tourism in the future in a Solomon Islands community. The results show that spatial conflicts within a community over territory and associated resources are likely to occur when designing natural resource management and tourism development plans.

131,132,"Urban commons are under pressure. City development has led to the encroachment and ecological degradation of urban open space. Although there is growing insight that urban ecosystems need to be protected, there is hardly any attention for the consequences (of both pressures and protection efforts) for vulnerable human population groups. We aim to understand how urban development affects the well-being of the urban poor, through shifts in ecosystem services (ES) and people’s responses to these shifts. We performed household interviews and group mapping sessions in seven urban lake communities in Bangalore, India. Changes at Bangalore’s lakes can be summarized by three trends: privatization followed by conversion, pollution followed by degradation, and restoration followed by gentrification. Over time, this resulted in a shift in the types of ES supplied and demanded, the nature of use, and de facto governance: from provisioning, communal and public; to cultural, individual, and private. Lake dwellers responded by finding (other) sources of income, accepting lower quality or less accessible ES, and/or completely stopping the use of certain ES. The consequences of ecosystem change for people’s well-being differ depending on a household’s ability to adapt and on individual circumstances, land tenure and financial capital in particular. To guarantee a future for Bangalore’s lakes, restoration seems the only viable option. Although beautiful lake parks may be a solution for the well-off and not-too-poor, leaving the very poor without options to adapt to the new circumstances puts them at risk of becoming even more marginalized. We show that ecosystem degradation and restoration alike can impact the well-being of the urban poor. People’s experiences allowed us to couple ecosystem change to well-being through ES and adaptation strategies. Hence, we revealed multiple cause-effect relations. Understanding these relations contributes to sustainable urban development for people from all layers of society. © 2017 by the author(s).","Environmental Geography Group, Department of Earth Sciences, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Netherlands

78,79,"In order to identify sustainable management solutions for small-scale farmer agroecosystems, a better understanding of these dynamic forest–farmland systems, existing farming and forestry strategies, and farmer perspectives is important. We examined the relationship between agricultural land use patterns and farmers’ practices and identified existing and potential characteristics of healthy agroecosystems at local scale in the context of village communities in Zanzibar, Tanzania. With in-depth household survey and participatory mapping, five distinct cropping patterns were identified and their relation to land cover elucidated. Consequences of the diverse local farming strategies to field level cultivation patterns are dynamic. However, long-term adaptation of the local farmers to prevailing edaphic site conditions and resource-poor circumstances create fragmented but fairly stable land use patterns at landscape level. By integrating local expert knowledge and realities with scientific knowledge, we identified sustainable agroecosystem characteristics and farming practices, which are knowledge-intensive, alternative and adaptable to local conditions. Some of these practices are already a part of the local farming strategies and some require training and higher level support to reach healthier agroecosystem and better food security. They also offer potential opportunities for forest conservation since their tree-based nature provide forest products to the communities. © , Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Geography Division, Department of Geography and Geology, University of Turku, Turku, Finland

21,22,"Children today are spending more sedentary time indoors than time playing and being active outdoors. The daily journey to and from school represents a valuable opportunity for children to be physically active through active school travel. The majority of research on children's active school travel omits children from the research process even though children interpret their environments in fundamentally different ways than adults. Our research uses innovative participatory mapping and qualitative GIS methods to examine how children's perceptions of their environments influence their school journey experiences. Through our thematic analysis of 25 map-based focus groups, we identified three main themes characterizing barriers and enablers to active school travel: safety-related, material, and affective features. By positioning children as experts of their environments in our participatory methodology, our findings provide an important counterpoint to the adultist privilege characterizing the majority of research on children's active school travel. Environmental features that mattered for children's school journeys took on multiple meanings in their eyes, demonstrating that children's perspectives must be engaged to inform interventions to promote active school travel. We thus argue that identifying barriers and enablers to active school travel for children requires engaging children's views. © 2018 The Authors.

121,122,"Transforming conservation science and practice calls for rallying people's interest in biodiversity while evaluating the response of biodiversity to anthropogenic transformations. Anthropogenic landscapes are critical as they encompass most of the available spaces for living species and shape evolutionary forces for wildlife in the Anthropocene. We propose a methodology to assess wildlife distribution and habitat suitability in such landscapes based-on local knowledge. With increasing human population and habitat degradation, human-baboon conflicts are exacerbating throughout the Western Cape, South Africa. During participatory mapping workshops, we collected baboon sightings and indices of landscape use by participants to control observer bias to model baboon occurrence using presence-only models (with MaxEnt). We considered different biases associated with citizen data in the modelling process and conducted field validations. Sightings redundancy allows identifying core and extended baboons distribution ranges. We found that the distances to protected areas and wildlife corridors were the main determinants of baboon occurrence while land-cover had little influence. This later result underlies baboons behavioural flexibility in coping with land-use change. Overall, our results are consistent with studies using GPS collars in similar environments. Beyond generating meaningful information to understand wildlife distribution in anthropogenic landscape with a low-cost, fast and non-invasive approach, our methodology allowed local stakeholders to share insights about human-baboon coexistence. Well-designed participatory and collaborative methodologies are critical in conservation programmes, we discuss the role of developing such participatory mapping and modelling approaches to not only produce relevant information when resources are limited but also to unravel local solutions for conservation. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Sustainability Research Unit, Nelson Mandela University (NMU), George Campus, Madiba, drive, George, 6531, South Africa

148,149,"Marine protected areas created in a top-down way can be costly and ineffective due to low compliance of resource users. Conversely, employing users' local knowledge and involving them in decision-making processes could decrease costs and conflicts, in addition to increasing the chances of management success. Here the potential to change conflicting MPAs into conservation areas that take into account fishers' use and knowledge is assessed based on a case study on the Brazilian coast (Paraty town). Fishers (n=206) from 11 villages were interviewed regarding their main fishing targets and gear, and then only the experienced ones (n=41) were interviewed from three main fishing villages about the most important commercial species. Fish landings were sampled for one year in these three villages (n=823), where participatory mapping and group interviews with fishers were also conducted to determine their opinions regarding management and how they thought it should be undertaken. Management measures should not be equivalent across the whole region, as there were clear differences in the target species and gear used. Fishers identified 55 important fishing spots, eight of which were important for more than five villages, while the experts identified 10 important fishing areas for the target species, which was supported by the sampling of fish landings. The fishers were not opposed to management and no-take reserves but would make some changes in the current design of these measures if it were up to them. Based on these data, a few changes were indicated in the design of these areas that would likely reduce the conflict between fishers and enforcement agencies. This kind of approach could be used as a framework for adapting conflictive MPAs or to support the establishment of new ones where fisheries are relevant. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte, Ecology Department, Natal, RN 59078-900, Brazil

119,120,"Increasingly, 'place', including physical and geographical characteristics as well as social meanings, is recognized as an important factor driving individual and community health risks. This is especially true among marginalized populations in low and middle income countries (LMIC), whose environments may also be more difficult to study using traditional methods. In the NIH-funded longitudinal study Mapa de Salud, we employed a novel approach to exploring the risk environment of female sex workers (FSWs) in two Mexico/U. S. border cities, Tijuana and Ciudad Juárez. In this paper we describe the development, implementation, and feasibility of a mix of quantitative and qualitative tools used to capture the HIV risk environments of FSWs in an LMIC setting. The methods were: 1) Participatory mapping; 2) Quantitative interviews; 3) Sex work venue field observation; 4) Time-locationactivity diaries; 5) In-depth interviews about daily activity spaces. We found that the mixed-methodology outlined was both feasible to implement and acceptable to participants. These methods can generate geospatial data to assess the role of the environment on drug and sexual risk behaviors among high risk populations. Additionally, the adaptation of existing methods for marginalized populations in resource constrained contexts provides new opportunities for informing public health interventions. © 2016 Conners et al.

99,100,"The comprehension of how fishing effort is distributed spatially and through time is essential for the success of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs). In order to achieve this, participatory mapping has been used as a method to obtain spatial data from artisanal fishermen, promoting more participatory decision-making processes. In the region of Pemibe, there are a range of management instruments that regulates the spatial distribution and establish fishing closure areas for this activity. In order to understand how the gill net artisanal fisheries, affect the existing closure areas in this region, interviews with local fishermen were conducted, on which participatory mapping exercises were performed. Therefore, it was possible to estimate the spatial distribution of the gill net fisheries in this region. There were points where densification of fishermen was identified and it was found that these points were located nearby the MPAs, therefore creating areas of incongruities between the conservation objectives established by the MPAs and the fishing activity. Thus, a better understanding of the reasons why the fishermen choose certain areas for fishing, as well as how they will behave in case of closure of existing fishing areas are necessary to achieve an effective management for the MPAs.",,"de Souza, V.

60,61,"Myanmar offers unique opportunities for both biodiversity conservation and foreign direct investment due to projected economic growth linked to natural resource exploitation. Industrial-scale development introduces new land uses into the landscape, with unknown repercussions for local communities and biodiversity conservation. We use participatory mapping of 31 communities, focus groups in 28 communities, and analyses of forest cover change during 2000-2010 using MODIS vegetation continuous fields images, to understand the social and environmental impacts of gold mining and agricultural concessions in Myanmar's Hukaung Valley (∼21,800 km2). Local communities, particularly the poorest households, benefit from work and trade opportunities offered by gold mining and agricultural companies but continue to depend on forests for house construction materials, food, and income from the sale of forest resources. However, gold mining and agricultural concessions reduce tree cover, potentially reducing access to forest resources and further marginalizing these households. Our analyses do not provide evidence that long-term resident communities contributed to forest cover loss between 2000 and 2010. We argue that landscape management, which recognizes local community rights to customary community use areas, and appropriate zoning for commercial land uses and protected areas could contribute to both local livelihoods and protect biodiversity throughout Myanmar during economic growth. © The Author(s) 2017.","School of Biological Sciences, Royal Holloway University of London, United Kingdom

88,89,"This article describes the participatory methods used for mapping the expectations and understandings of Kampala city and its shitscape. I defined the shitscape as the collective sanitary apparatus that the city's inhabitants utilise, and the relationships that mediate these infrastructures and practices. Analysis of Kampala's shitscape therefore encounters flush toilets and latrines, septic tanks and sewage pipes, and extends to plastic bags and bottles and the wastewater channels that are used to dispose of them. The analysis examines what assumptions are made about particular toileting performances and engages with knowledge(s) of the city and its sanitation infrastructures and practices. Interviews, observations and participatory mapping were conducted in numerous places throughout the city and I utilised the city's main drainage-channel-cum-river, the Nakivubo Channel, as a transect - observing, interviewing, and conducting participatory mapping with the city's inhabitants I met along the Nakivubo's course. Whilst the participatory mapping methods illustrate clear distinctions in the imagination of the city as un/sanitary, un/civilised and un/modern, the qualitative research contradicts this representation. This research suggests, then, that maps - whether archival or participatory - cannot and do not tell the whole story of a city. The ethnographic and in-depth qualitative research shows that different sanitary performances, such as using a flush toilet and using a plastic bag to shit in, are in fact bound by the same moralities of waste disposal and minimising smell. Flying toilets are not, then, a symbol of disgusting and uncivil behaviour, but rather as effective toileting solutions in highly restricted circumstances.",,"Brown, S.

It exposes the incomplete and complex processes of space-making produced by armed conflict, as well as the ambivalent and shifting character of peasant political strategies in the context of violence. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Department of History and Social Sciences, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia","Berman-Arévalo, E.",2019,,Journal of Peasant Studies,"Mapping violent land orders: armed conflict, moral economies, and the trajectories of land occupation and dispossession in the Colombian Caribbean*"
69,70,"Integrating scientific and local knowledge within disaster risk reduction (DRR) using methods that encourage knowledge exchange and two-way dialogue is a difficult yet important task. This article shows how participatory mapping can help in fostering integrative DRR through the involvement of a large range of stakeholders. It draws on a project conducted in the municipality of Masantol, Philippines that is regularly affected by flooding and other natural hazards. Participatory 3-Dimensional Mapping, or P3DM, has been used for both risk assessment and DRR planning. P3DM facilitates the interpretation, assimilation and understanding of geo-referenced data by making them visible and tangible to everyone. Given that maps are scaled and geo-referenced, P3DM also helps in incorporating both local and scientific knowledge through a two-way dialogue in DRR. © 2011 The Authors.

155,156,"This paper investigates the ecological, social and institutional dimensions of the synergies and trade-offs between seagrasses and human activities operating in the Natura 2000 protected site of San Simon Bay (Galicia, NW Spain). By means of a multidisciplinary approach that brings together the development of a biological inventory combined with participatory mapping processes we get key spatial and contextual understanding regarding how, where and why marine users interact with seagrasses and how seagrasses are considered in policy making. The results highlight the fisheries' reliance on seagrass meadows and the controversial links with shellfisheries. The study also reveals unresolved conflicts among those management plans that promote the protection of natural values and those responsible for the exploitation of marine resources. We conclude that the adoption of preplanning bottom-up participatory processes is crucial for the design of realistic strategies where both seagrasses and human activities were considered as a couple system.

126,127,"Framed by questions about “hydrocitizenship” in the 21st century, this co-produced, interdisciplinary arts and humanities-centred research explores the (re)weaving of local knowledges, experiences, perceptions, and values of water and place through the concept, process, and practice of “daylighting hidden rivers.” Located at the nexus of three theoretical frames – “participation,” “hydrocitizenship,” and “daylighting,” it engages reflexively with strong and weak “hydrocitizenship” and with paradigms of ‘daylighting.’ Working with diverse communities and organisations in South Bristol (UK), this eco-social research project discovered community concerns and needs, and positioned itself in relation to these in co-production. This involved older people, children, and professional stakeholders in a place-specific, “catchment” setting, using novel arts-led, creative, narrative mapping processes. We critically examined the value, opportunities, and tensions of this multi-method approach to people's past, present, and future connections and relationships with their local (water) environment, their senses of self and community. Our iterative processes of seeking out “lesser heard” voices were conceived and played out around a braided cascade of “openings”: emerging, connecting, enacting, imagining, and reflecting. Thinking critically about our oblique, emergent processes, we identify 15 “top tips” concerning the creative participatory daylighting of lay knowledges and values, and “river visioning.” These can inform co-working with communities to enable and empower citizen engagement with places and local water issues for resilient futures. Our findings contribute new understandings of “hydrocitizenship” and creative participatory “daylighting” in combination, when urban spaces are construed as “water cities,” cascading both water and narratives. Importantly, our co-production processes with lesser heard groups also exemplify “higher-order participation” in co-visioning resilient futures, with all the messiness, complexity, and conflicts exposed.

90,91,"In the period of rapid urbanization of China at present, studies on the meaning space structure in rural villages will be helpful for understanding the complicated psychological bond between community members and residential settings, and conducive to mitigate social frictions and conflicts caused by non-economic factors in the village demolition and relocation process. In this research, data were collected by semi-structured interview and participatory mapping techniques, and 251 residents from 9 villages were investigated. Those villages would be removed and relocated for the registration of Han Chang'an City Historical Site as a UNESCO World Culture Heritage. Through qualitative analysis of the interviews, 12 place feature categories, 7 place meaning categories and 34 place meaning sub-categories were identified. Based on the above attribute analysis, cross-tabulation analysis was used to examine the association between place features and meanings, and GIS tool was used to reveal and visualize the residents' place perception spatial configuration. The findings show that village, culture relics, house and people are among the significant place features, and person-place fit, personal feelings, historical-cultural connection, values and accomplishments are the important meaning categories. As the carriers, place features symbolize place meanings in both collective and selective ways. Place features form a system together with associated meanings, by which the place is defined and distinguished from other places. In addition, there exists a spatial pattern of residents' perceptions, which is characterized by the perception hotspot areas around the villages and relics, carrying important place meanings of local people in the study area. Feeling connection, place fit and personal identity make sense for the explanation to the revealed meaning space structure. The extending suggestion of this study is that the preservation of typical place features for local people in some forms will be helpful for the removal communities preserving homeland attachment. © 2015, Science Press.

30,31,"Projections pertaining to future land use and land use change may have diverse backgrounds. Often, both local and scientific knowledge encompass important pieces of information for such a projection. Acknowledging the diversity across the two types of knowledge, we investigated their differences and similarities in a twofold case study, conducting a participatory mapping (PM) exercise with local wine growers, as well as a Multi Criteria Evaluation (MCE) with non-local experts from science, government and industry. Hence, we not only utilised two different knowledge elicitation methods, but also two types of ‘knowledges’. Within a region dominated by vineyards, and with expected land use change, we compared the two results quantitatively, in a participatory evaluation workshop, and with annotations gained through the participatory mapping exercise. Both methods have their merits, with the results from the participatory mapping perceived as being more plausible, and the MCE scoring higher in terms of spatial resolution. Whilst the participatory mapping yields more and better contextualised information, the results from the MCE can be better compared across study areas. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Department of Geography, University of Zurich, Switzerland

Using a livelihoods framework, we explore gendered dimensions of access to assets or resources, agricultural practices, and knowledge and perceptions in the context of food security and soil conservation. Our mixed methods approach includes focus group discussions, household interviews, participatory mapping, and GPS mapping. We found that men and women have different access to assets, gender roles, and soil perceptions that could have implications for whether farmers adopt conservation agriculture (CA) in the Philippines.

130,131,"Understanding the perception of environmental resources by the users is an important element in planning its sustainable use and management. Pastoralist communities manage their vast grazing territories and exploit resource variability through strategic mobility. However, the knowledge on which pastoralists’ resource management is based and their perception of the grazing areas has received limited attention. To improve this understanding and to document this knowledge in a way that can be communicated with ‘outsiders’, we adopted a participatory mapping approach using satellite imagery to explore how Borana pastoralists of southern Ethiopia differentiated and characterized their grazing areas. The Borana herders conceptualized their grazing areas as set of distinctive grazing units each having specific names and characteristics. The precise location and the borders of each grazing unit were identified on the satellite image. In naming of the grazing units, the main differentiating criteria were landforms, vegetation types, prevalence of wildlife species, and manmade features. Based on the dominant soil type, the grazing units were aggregated into seasonal grazing areas that were described using factors such as soil drainage properties, extent of woody cover, main grass species, and prevalence of ecto-parasites. Pastoralists ranking of the seasonal grazing areas according to their suitability for cattle grazing matched with vegetation assessment results on the abundance of desirable fodder varieties. Approaching grazing area differentiation from the pastoralists’ perspectives improves the understanding of rangeland characteristics that pastoralists considered important in their grazing management and visualization of their mental representation in digital maps eases communication of this knowledge. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","German Institute for Tropical and Sub-tropical Agriculture (DITSL), University of Kassel, Kassel, Germany

71,72,"The value of Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) for informing resource management has long been recognized; however, its incorporation into ecosystem services (ES) assessments remains uncommon. Often ""top-down"" approaches are utilized, depending on ""expert knowledge"", that are not relevant to local resource users. Here we propose an approach for combining participatory methods with remote sensing to provide a more holistic understanding of ES change. Participatory mapping in focus group discussions identified TEK regarding what ES were present, where, and their value to communities. TEK was then integrated with satellite imagery to extrapolate to the landscape-scale. We demonstrate our method for Nyangatom communities in the Lower Omo Valley, Ethiopia, showing for the first time the ES impacts of regional environmental change, including the Gibe III dam, for communities in the Omo River basin. Results confirmed the collapse of flood-retreat cultivation associated with the loss of the annual Omo flood. Communities reported declines in many other provisioning ES, and these results were supported by satellite mapping, which showed substantial reductions in land covers with high ES value (shrubland and wetland), leading to consequent ES declines. Our mixed-methods approach has potential to be applied in other regions to generate locally relevant information for evaluating ES dynamics and improving management of natural resources. © 2019 by the authors.","Department of Community Sustainability, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI 48824, United States

Participatory mapping and focus group discussions were incorporated, to develop reference points, training sites and land use areas by villages. The results showed that expansion of occupied lands occurred from 25.4% in 1986 to 44.8% in 2014 with associated increasing population densities. Predicted land-use/land-cover changes indicated 52% expansion of occupied lands over a 15 year period. Much of that expansion was from vegetation and waterlogging. The results also showed large patterns of waterlogging in the area. The existing and predicted landscape character in the area indicated unsuitable environments for enhanced resettlement and livelihood to potentially displaced communities as a result of future mining operations. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Department of Spatial Sciences, Western Australian School of Mines (WASM), Faculty of Science and Engineering, Curtin University, GPO Box U 1987, Perth, Western Australia, Australia",,2016,Sustainable,Journal of Cleaner Production,Landscape assessment for sustainable resettlement of potentially displaced communities in Ghana's emerging northwest gold province
29,30,"Community participation is an increasing issue in risk and disaster management. This paper argues that interdisciplinary methods are necessary for mapping flooding areas. On the one hand, hazards can be quantified and mapped through deductive approaches and methods from the natural sciences. On the other hand, hazards can also be described from the population perspective at a local level using social sciences methods. The methods are successfully mixed with a geographical information system environment. In the first case, important inputs include topographic and slope data for geomorphological mapping. In the second case, timeline methodology can indicate temporally the most severe floods, and a participatory map construction gives the population the opportunity to point out the affected areas. These methods were applied in a case study in the lower Amazon River Region in the urban area of the Santarém municipality. High-resolution images and remote sensing were essential tools. Results show that nine neighborhoods have high and moderate susceptibility areas to riverine floods. Another nine neighborhoods are affected by flash floods.

83,84,"The European Commission promotes management practices for nature conservation and human well-being, requiring the involvement of users in Natura 2000 sites. The research aim was to investigate the user's aesthetic perception in relation to the adoption of different management measures, within an Italian metropolitan Natura 2000 site. The research was performed in La Mandria Park in 2018 (1780 ha). The method was based on a participatory approach (interviews, questionnaires and participatory mapping), involving both park managers and users. Four main landscape elements were identified: lawns, woodlands, lines of trees and water bodies. Questionnaires (N = 232) were analyzed by descriptive and regression analysis. Mapped preferred places were analyzed using ecological indexes on 500 m land use buffers. A gendered perception of the aesthetic quality was detected, demonstrating that women are more strictly connected to nature than men. Users involved in park activities better perceived the aesthetic quality, while regular visitors had a worst perception. From participatory mapping (N = 137), it emerges that the eight preferred places are characterized by a mixed land use with different maintenance regimes and ecological values. Users' perceptions should be integrated in a co-management plan in metropolitan Natura 2000 sites, combining nature conservation with user enjoyment. © 2019 by the authors.","Department of Agricultural, Forest and Food Sciences, University of Turin, Grugliasco (TO), 10095, Italy

We investigated forest ecosystem services utilized by communities living around the Bach Ma National Park, Vietnam, and examined their spatial distributions through the integration of data from interviews, participatory mapping, and GIS analysis. The results suggest that provisioning services are crucial to the local livelihoods, and especially for an ethnic minority group. Many respondents confirmed the collection of specific types of forest foods, materials, and water resources mainly used for family consumption. We conducted spatial pattern analysis with land use, administrative units, terrain conditions, and accessibility, and clarified the characteristics of the spatial distribution of ecosystem service collection in relation to these factors, resource abundance, and forest governance.

138,139,"According to the U.S. National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA), federal action to manipulate habitat for species conservation requires an environmental impact statement, which should integrate natural, physical, economic, and social sciences in planning and decision making. Nonetheless, most impact assessments focus disproportionately on physical or ecological impacts rather than integrating ecological and socioeconomic components. We developed a participatory social-ecological impact assessment (SEIA) that addresses the requirements of NEPA and integrates social and ecological concepts for impact assessments. We cooperated with the Bureau of Land Management in Idaho, USA on a project designed to restore habitat for the Greater Sage-Grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus). We employed questionnaires, workshop dialogue, and participatory mapping exercises with stakeholders to identify potential environmental changes and subsequent impacts expected to result from the removal of western juniper (Juniperus occidentalis). Via questionnaires and workshop dialogue, stakeholders identified 46 environmental changes and associated positive or negative impacts to people and communities in Owyhee County, Idaho. Results of the participatory mapping exercises showed that the spatial distribution of social, economic, and ecological values throughout Owyhee County are highly associated with the two main watersheds, wilderness areas, and the historic town of Silver City. Altogether, the SEIA process revealed that perceptions of project scale varied among participants, highlighting the need for specificity about spatial and temporal scales. Overall, the SEIA generated substantial information concerning potential impacts associated with habitat treatments for Greater Sage-Grouse. The SEIA is transferable to other land management and conservation contexts because it supports holistic understanding and framing of connections between humans and ecosystems. By applying this SEIA framework, land managers and affected people have an opportunity to fulfill NEPA requirements and develop more comprehensive management plans that better reflect the linkages of social-ecological systems.",,"Rachlow, J.

169,170,"Six Rapid Rural Appraisal tools were tested by exploring four questions about gender and forests in two communities in the State of Washington. Tools selected include: Who Counts Matrix, Pebble Sorts (2), Participatory Mapping, Visioning, and an Interview Guide. The resulting data were supplemented by a questionnaire and ethnographic methods. The four questions asked whether men and women think differently about the forest, engage with the forest differently, go to different natural places, and have different visions of the future of the forest and their community. The results showed surprisingly comparable engagement with the forest by men and women and similarities in their visions of the future. In contrast, differences were found in the ways women and men think about the forest and the places they visit. The significant demographic shift toward an older population was also of interest. The use of Rapid Rural Appraisal tools in this setting was instructive, and further application is warranted, particularly when considering collaborative forest management.

32,33,"Measurement, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) systems are thought to be essential for effective carbon accounting and joint REDD+ carbon, conservation, and social development goals. Community participation in MRV (PMRV) has been shown to be both cost effective and accurate, as well as a method to potentially advance stakeholder empowerment and perceptions of legitimacy. Recognizing land tenure as a long-standing point of tension in REDD+ planning, we argue that its engagement also has a key role to play in developing a legitimate PMRV. Using household surveys, key informant interviews, and participatory mapping exercises, we present three 'lived' land tenure contexts in Indonesia to highlight their socially and ecologically situated natures and to consider the role of tenure pluralism in shaping PMRV. We then raise and interrogate three questions for incorporating lived land tenure contexts into a legitimate PMRV system: 1) Who holds the right to conduct PMRV activities?; 2) How are the impacts of PMRV differentially distributed within local communities?; and 3) What is the relationship between tenure security and motivation to participate in PMRV? We conclude with implementation lessons for REDD+ practitioners, including the benefits of collaborative practices, and point to critical areas for further research. © 2017 Felker et al.This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.","Center for International Forestry Research, Bogor, Indonesia

106,107,"Background: Capture-recapture methodology has been employed to estimate the size of hidden or difficult-to-reach human populations such as sex workers, homeless persons, and intravenous drug users. This study took place in the context of efforts to improve the quality of curative and preventive services for sexually transmitted infections offered to sex workers in Diego-Suarez, Madagascar in partnership with sex workers. Goal: The goal of this study was to better understand sex-trading practices, map out sex work sites, and estimate the size of a mobile sex-worker population in Diego-Suarez, Madagascar using methods that can be reproduced in other resource-poor settings. Study Design: Forty sex workers were trained to function as field researchers. Key informants in designated neighborhoods were identified and interviewed. Basic maps of sex-trade sites were designed by hand. The number of sex workers in Diego-Suarez was estimated using capture-recapture methodology. An educational brochure was used to ""capture"" sex workers during a first phase, and ""recapture"" 2 weeks later. Results: Most sex trade was street based and mobile. Capture-recapture methods estimated a total of 2684 sex workers (95% CI: 2588-2780) in Diego-Suarez, or approximately 12% of the 15- to 49-year-old female population in the city. Conclusion: Geographic mapping and capture-recapture proved to be low-cost and relatively easy to use techniques for counting a hard-to-reach population, such as female street-based sex workers. Sex workers can be capable fieldworkers, and their active participation in research concerning sex work should be considered whenever possible. A high proportion of women of reproductive age were found to engage in sex work, indicating that there is an urgent need to scale up sexually transmitted infection and HIV prevention activities targeting sex workers, their sexual partners, and the general population.","Family Health International, Arlington, VA, United States

158,159,"Upland agricultural systems are rapidly transitioning from traditional shifting cultivation to more commercialized agriculture, i.e. annual cash crop cultivation - a trend widely observed in the uplands of Northern Lao P.D.R. and with consequences to household livelihood strategies at the village-level. The main objective of this study was to compare village and household socioeconomic standings of two upland agricultural systems varying in degree of commercialization in Northern Lao P.D.R.: i) Navene, a village with a relatively recent introduction (2010) of the cash crop, fodder maize, where it is cultivated extensively with no added external inputs or mechanization and ii) Ko Ngiaw, where cultivation was introduced in 2004 and fodder maize is now successively cultivated on ploughed upland fields with herbicide application. Participatory mapping, household surveys (during planting and harvesting), farmer activity books and ranking exercises were conducted to collect data on village and household resources, crop production (upland rice, paddy rice and maize), labour productivity (maize) and general perspectives on commercial agriculture. We show both infrastructure development and accessibility (market access, support and services) are important underlying drivers of the commercialization of agriculture in upland areas. This leads to a transition of upland livelihoods towards market orientation, with implications to household demographics, socioeconomic standings and income portfolios. Results capture how market integration progressively decouples livelihood strategies from the 'land', exposing households to market volatilizations, indebtedness and socio-cultural losses. Food security is no longer perceived from a 'producer's' standpoint but from a 'consumer's' as commercialized upland households are more dependent on markets for their food supply. We conclude that proper services, support and access to i.e. markets or non-farm employment in conjunction with infrastructure development should be prioritized if upland households are to transition towards commercialized agriculture equally and with minimal risk to their livelihood security.",,"de Neergaard, A.",2019,,Njas-Wageningen Journal of Life Sciences,Transitioning towards commercial upland agriculture: A comparative study in Northern Lao PDR
